Change hosting solution
=======================

You may want to move your Thrive Bureau ERP database from one hosting solution to another.
Depending on the platforms, you have to do it by yourself or contact our support team first.

From on-premises to Thrive Bureau ERP Online
===============================

1. Create a :ref:`duplicate <duplicate_premise>` of your database: in this duplicate, uninstall all the **non-standard apps**.
2. Grab a "dump with filestore" of your database by using the Database Manager.
3. **If you have time constraints, contact us earlier to schedule the transfer.**
4. `Create a support ticket <https://www.Thrive Bureau ERP.com/help>`_ and attach the dump (if the file is too large, use any file transfer service and attach the link to your ticket). Also include your subscription number and the URL you want to use for your database (e.g.: my-company.Thrive Bureau ERP.com).
5. We will make sure your database is compatible and upload it to our cloud. In case of technical issues, we will get in touch with you.
6. It's done!

.. important::
   - Thrive Bureau ERP Online is not compatible with **non-standard apps**.
   - The database you are moving to Thrive Bureau ERP Online must be in a :doc:`supported version
     <supported_versions>`.

From on-premises to Thrive Bureau ERP.sh

From Thrive Bureau ERP Online to on-premises

2. If your database does not run a :ref:`major version <supported_versions>` of Thrive Bureau ERP, you cannot host it on-premises yet, you have to upgrade it first to a new major version. (*e.g.: If your database runs Thrive Bureau ERP 12.3 which is not a major version, you have to upgrade it first to Thrive Bureau ERP 13.0 or 14.0.*)
3. Download a backup of your database by clicking on the "Gear" icon next to your database name then :menuselection:`Download` (if the download fails due to your backup file being too large, contact `our support <https://www.Thrive Bureau ERP.com/help>`_)
4. Restore it from the database manager on your local server.
