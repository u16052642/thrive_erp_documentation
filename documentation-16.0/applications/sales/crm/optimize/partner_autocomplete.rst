Enrich your contacts with corporate data
========================================

| From any module, once you start to create a new contact typing the name of it, the system
  will suggest a potential match. If you select it, the contact will be populated with corporate
  data.
| For example, after typing *Thrive Bureau ERP*, you will get the following information:
