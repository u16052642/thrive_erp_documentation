| AND:
|  _____________________________________________, a company having its registered office at
|  _____________________________________________________________________________________.
|  (hereinafter referred to as “PARTNER”)

Thrive Bureau ERP and PARTNER are individually referred to as a "Party" and collectively referred to as
"the Parties".

1 Purpose
=========
The purpose of this agreement is to set forth the conditions under which Thrive Bureau ERP provides services to
PARTNER, access to the Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition software, and under which PARTNER complies with the
obligations set out hereafter.

Thrive Bureau ERP hereby appoints PARTNER, and PARTNER hereby accepts the appointment, to be a non-exclusive partner
promoting and selling "Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition" to customers.

PARTNER commits to doing its best effort to sell Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise contracts to its clients.
To support that, PARTNER will market in priority the "Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition" version to prospects
and customers. PARTNER still has the option to sell services on other versions of the software,
like "Thrive Bureau ERP Community Edition", should it be needed.

2 Term of the Agreement
=======================
The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be one year beginning on the date of the signature.
It is automatically renewed for an equal Term unless either party provides written notice of
termination minimum 30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.


3 Access to Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition
===================================

3.1 Project platform access
---------------------------
To help PARTNER promote Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition, Thrive Bureau ERP grants PARTNER access to its project code repository
for all "Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition" Apps, under the terms set forth in :ref:`appendix_p_a`
and the conditions restricted under this Agreement.

In addition, Thrive Bureau ERP grants PARTNER free access to the Thrive Bureau ERP.SH platform for testing and development
purposes.

.. _restrictions:

3.2 Restrictions
----------------
PARTNER commits to keeping confidentiality of the source code of Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition Apps
within its staff. Access to the source code of Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition for customers is
governed by the Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Subscription Agreement.
PARTNER agrees to NOT redistribute this code to third parties without the written permission of Thrive Bureau ERP.

PARTNER commits to not offer services on Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition to customers who are not covered
by an Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise subscription, even during the implementation phase.

Notwithstanding the above, PARTNER commits to wholly preserve the integrity of the
Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition code that is required to verify the validity of usage of Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise
Edition and to collect statistics that are needed for that purpose.

PARTNER is not allowed to block, restrict or limit in any way the customer's access and use of
the Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise Edition License, without prior consultation and written authorisation from Thrive Bureau ERP.


4 Partnership Services
======================

4.1 Partnership levels
----------------------
The Thrive Bureau ERP partner program consists of two types of partnerships and four levels;
“Learning Partners” is for companies who want everything necessary to start implementing Thrive Bureau ERP,
without visibility as an official partner until they get the required experience;
“Official Partners” is for companies who want the visibility as Ready, Silver, and Gold,
according to their experience with Thrive Bureau ERP.

Partnership level granted to PARTNER depends on the *net new Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise users sold* in
the last 12 months, the number of certified resources and the customer
Retention Rate. The *net new Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise users sold* includes new customers, upsells on existing
customer, downsells on existing customers, and customer churn.
Renewals of existing contracts do not count towards the number of Users Sold, but PARTNER
still gets a commission on these contracts as stated in section :ref:`benefits`.

The table below summarizes the requirements that have to be met for each partnership level.

The customer *Retention Rate* is calculated by dividing the total number of Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise customers
acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years that are currently active by the total number of Thrive Bureau ERP Enterprise
customers acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years.

+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Certifications are personal, so when a certified staff member leaves or joins the company,
PARTNER must notify Thrive Bureau ERP.

PARTNER's partnership level will be reviewed quarterly by Thrive Bureau ERP, and adjusted
to the highest level for which the 3 requirements are met.

However, "Official Partners" may be upgraded automatically to a higher level once they reach the
3 requirements for that higher partnership level.
